Read Servers with Node/Express > Using Query Parameters and answer the following questions

What is the purpose of a Query String?

A query string allows information to be sent to a website for it to store and read when needed. This information can be be used for making requests, adding content, and so much more.

What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

A query Parameter is in a "Key = Value" pair. If there are mulitple queries then they are seperated with a "&". ex. ?a=4&b=3 

When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

I think that using a Query Parameter to search for information from a list of mutiple possiblities to find a specific target would be very useful. Finding a specific user and their info perhaps or keeping logic working smoothly by draw key elements from a server instead of hard coding information would be usefull too.
