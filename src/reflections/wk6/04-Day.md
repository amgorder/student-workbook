Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > Using Nested Routes in Vue.js and answer the following questions


What is a nested route?

A nested route is a path in an object inside of a path. As from the reading, /travel is a path in "routes" yet "routes" has children with paths as well: travel/America and travel/china

When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

I  can see the benefit of using nested routes for a better ui experience and keeping your code clean. User paths might be a good use of nested routes as well.

Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes, you can and you could pass parameters though to in functions that update.
