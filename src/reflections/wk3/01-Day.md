What problem does using exports solve?

 You can concatenate all scripts in one main script by marking some of them as exports, then other modules can import them.

How does export differ from export default?

To export a single value or to have a fallback value for your module, you could use a default export

What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Code can be split into smaller files of self-contained functionality.
Multiple scripts can be concatenated thereby increasing performance.
Debugging becomes easier.
