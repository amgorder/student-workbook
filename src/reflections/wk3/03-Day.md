What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

GET and SET

What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?

The GET operator takes two paramerters to work proporly. The object itself and the property being accessed.

What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

By setting up a proxy, we can add custom validation before we set the value. If the value doesn't pass, an error can be set.
