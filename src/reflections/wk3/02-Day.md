What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapsulation keeps data and methods that access data together and keeping outside access restricted. Timing dependencies and resource conflicts caused by trying to share the same memory resources are avoided by doing this.

What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

Underscore prefixed methods refer to methods that they do not intend users to call directly. If their implementations change, or if they're entirely deleted, developers would not consider that to be a breaking change. Many new developers are unaware of the underscore prefix convention, so may use the properties anyway.


How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

Developers denote private properties and methods by prefixing them with underscores. Because it has become recongnized as a best practice.
