What is the purpose of Async/Await?

They reduce the boilerplate around promises, and the "don't break the chain" limitation of chaining promises.

What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?

AWAIT can only be used inside of a ASYNC Function.

What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?

The code is easier to read compared to plain promises with chaining and callbacks. Async/await makes debugging less complicated because to the compiler it's just like synchronous code.
