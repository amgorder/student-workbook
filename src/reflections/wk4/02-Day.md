What are the three states of a Promise?

Pending: Initial State (before the Promise succeeds or fails)
Resolved: Completed Promise
Rejected: Failed Promise

How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Better definition of control flow of asynchronous logic, reduced coupling, and better error handling
improved readability. JavaScript promises let your async call return a value like synchronous function, that value is an object that promises success or failure value. 


What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?

The then( ) method is only for resolved Promises. Use the catch( ) method if the Promise fails.
