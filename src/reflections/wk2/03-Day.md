What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

Print statments from within the project.
Console.log method to see returned values refrenced in them.
Console.error (try /catch) for error calls to API.


Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The ELEMENTS tab opens access to the DOM and changes made here will be immediately updated on the screen. From here changes can be visually applied and then copied over to a css or html code. 


Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Using the JavaScript Debugging pane. Using break points and steping through problems to see what values are being pasted.
