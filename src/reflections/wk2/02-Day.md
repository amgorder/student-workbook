What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

sets a variable, evaluates a condition, preforms an action
function name(a, b; a > b; a++) {
}

uses variables and preforms a block of code
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a + b;   
}

a function used as a variable
let func = myFunction(a, b)

What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Arguments pass a condition based on a value (1 + 2); while parameters hold a variable (x + y).

What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

A Higher-Order function is a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output.
