What is Scope?

Scope is the accessibility of a variable. An example of Local Scope would be a variable inside of a function has a scope relative to the function. An example of Global Scope would be declared CONST variables scope relative to its availability everywhere.

What is Hoisting?

Hoisting is when a variable is being declared after it has been used. This is one of the reasons we use LET instead of VAR as a best practice. VAR can be hoisted, LET does not.

In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

CONST is used when a variable should not be changed. LET is used as a variable that its value can be changed. VAR is used in the case where you would want to utilize the hoisting feature.
